Corrections and Clarifications

1. Return statements
   Checking whether a return statement returns a value with an appropriate
   type is part of type-checking. Also, the type checker must make sure that
   a return statement without a value to return does not appear in a method
   which returns a value, and a return statement with a value to return does
   not appear in a void method.
   A good compiler also checks that it is impossible to reach the end of a
   method which returns a value ... it generates an error message along the
   lines of "not all paths return a value". This kind of check logically
   requires another traversal over the AST with a different visitor.
   To keep the programming task reasonable for Assignment 3, this check will
   not be required.

2. Unreachable Code
   Any statements which follow a return statement in Cb are unreachable. A good
   compiler would issue a warning message when that occurs. However, the full
   check for unreachability is not totally trivial. If both parts of an if-then-
   else statement end with return statements, then any statement following the
   if statement is unreachable.
   Again, to keep the programming task reasonable for Assignment 3, this check
   will not be required. However, if you do choose to implement the check for all
   paths returning a value, it is a simple matter to include a full check for
   statement reachability in that same checking code.

3. Unused Local Variables
   A good compiler issues a warning message for any local variable which is
   declared but never used. This is an easy check to perform (it just requires
   a bool flag to be associated with each symbol table entry). But again,
   such checking is not required for Assignment 3.

4. Local Variables Used Before Being Assigned
   A good compiler issues an error message or a warning message if a variable
   can be used before it has been assigned a value. Checking for this condition
   is not trivial and is not inclded in Assignment 3. However ... such checking
   is inherent in the SSA code which will be created for Assignment 4. We will
   get this check for free.

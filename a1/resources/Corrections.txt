Corrections / Clarifications for Assignment 1


1. The grammar included in the CbLangSpec.pdf document contained two errors.
   *  The grammar rule for ConstDecl should not include the keyword "static".
      Please delete that keyword from the rule's righthand side.
   *  The nonterminal symbol Factor should have one more alternative listed.
      Please add the additional alternative: charConst

2. The document says that the /* ... */  form of comment can be nested.
   The Microsoft C# compiler does not permit this nesting of comments.
   However, it is fun and a good exercise in using gplex, so our Cb compiler
   will permit such nesting even if it's not supported by C# compilers.

The Cb Language Specification document has been updated to incorporate these
corrections.

This document will grow if and when needed!
